                <p>Hello, my name is Steven Han, and I am a senior standing student in NYU studying for a BS degree in Computer Science. I come from East Brunswick, New Jersey, and one of my biggest passions is to create. From videos to stories to engineering projects and programs, I love being able to help make something that is functional and is able to showcase the fruits of my learnings. I always love to learn new things and physically use it in a way that shows to me that I have learned and made this knowledge useful. This is where my passion in STEM and primarily computer science comes from. I have explored this passion through personal projects such as my Love Letter Simulator Website and SoftSound android application, to community activities such as the Cyberware startup I am a part of as well as the Urban Biking Smart Helmet I helped my team create, to formal internships such as my time as a Research and Development Intern at Henkel, where I helped my team research and formulate new adhesives that would benefit the company and the food packaging industry, and my time as a software engineer intern at Bank of America.</p>
