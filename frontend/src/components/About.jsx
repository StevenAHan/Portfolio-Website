            <p>
                Hello, I am a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at NYU. 
                Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable experience and insights by engaging in various internships. 
                In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as a Software Engineering intern at Bank of America, 
                where I honed my skills and contributed to real-world projects. 
                Prior to that, in the summer of 2022, I served as a Research and Development intern at Henkel, 
                expanding my knowledge in a different domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my academic pursuits, I am thrilled to take on the role of a Course Assistant in Design and Analysis of Algorithms. 
                This opportunity allows me to assist fellow students and deepen my understanding of this crucial area of study.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the reasons I chose Computer Science as my field of study is my passion for creating new things. 
                I find immense joy and fulfillment in the process of turning ideas into reality through coding and problem-solving. 
                The boundless potential for innovation in the world of CS has continually inspired me to push my limits and explore new horizons.
            </p>

            <p>
                By combining my academic endeavors, practical experience, and unwavering enthusiasm for creating, 
                I strive to make a meaningful impact in the field of Computer Science and contribute to the development of 
                innovative solutions.
